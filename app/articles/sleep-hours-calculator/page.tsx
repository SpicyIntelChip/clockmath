      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Ever wake up and wonder how long you actually slept? Estimating isn't enough — knowing your sleep duration helps track rest and improve health. Whether you're trying to optimize your sleep schedule or just curious about your rest patterns, accurate sleep tracking is the first step.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Track Sleep?</h2>
      <p>
        Doctors recommend 7–9 hours of sleep for most adults. Without accurate tracking, you might think you got "enough" when in reality you didn't. Poor sleep affects everything from mood and productivity to immune function and weight management.
      </p>

      <h2>Quick Sleep Calculation</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of guessing, try our <Link href="/" className="text-emerald-600 hover:text-emerald-500 font-medium">hours calculator</Link>. Enter your bedtime and wake-up time, and you'll instantly know how long you slept. The calculator automatically handles overnight periods, so you don't need to worry about crossing midnight.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl my-6">
        <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Example Sleep Calculation</h3>
        <div className="space-y-2 text-sm">
          <div><strong>Bedtime:</strong> 11:20 PM</div>
          <div><strong>Wake-up:</strong> 6:45 AM</div>
          <div className="pt-2 border-t border-slate-200 dark:border-slate-700">
            <strong>➡ Total Sleep = 7 hours 25 minutes</strong>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Understanding Your Sleep Patterns</h2>
      <p>
        Consistent sleep tracking reveals patterns you might not notice otherwise. Maybe you sleep better on weekends, or perhaps that late coffee affects your bedtime more than you thought. Use our <Link href="/" className="text-emerald-600 hover:text-emerald-500 font-medium">duration calculator</Link> to log your sleep for a week and see what patterns emerge.
      </p>

      <h2>Tips for Better Sleep Tracking</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Be consistent:</strong> Track every night, not just when you remember</li>
        <li><strong>Note quality too:</strong> Duration isn't everything—how rested do you feel?</li>
        <li><strong>Track factors:</strong> Note caffeine, exercise, screen time before bed</li>
        <li><strong>Use the data:</strong> Adjust your schedule based on what you learn</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding your real sleep patterns starts with accurate calculation. Use ClockMath's <Link href="/" className="text-emerald-600 hover:text-emerald-500 font-medium">time duration calculator</Link> to see exactly how much rest you got.
