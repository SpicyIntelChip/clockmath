      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Overtime pay can make a big difference in your paycheck, but only if hours are tracked correctly. Manually calculating overtime can get confusing, especially with different overtime rules and varying shift lengths. Getting it wrong means losing money you've earned.
      </p>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Most workplaces pay overtime after 8 hours per day or 40 hours per week, typically at 1.5x your regular rate. Miscalculations can cost you significant money over time. Even a few minutes here and there add up when multiplied by overtime rates.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Calculate Instantly</h2>
      <p>
        Use our <Link href="/" className="text-emerald-600 hover:text-emerald-500 font-medium">elapsed time calculator</Link> to find your total hours worked. Once you know the exact duration, determining regular vs. overtime hours becomes straightforward. The calculator handles complex scenarios like shifts crossing midnight automatically.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl my-6">
        <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Example Overtime Calculation</h3>
        <div className="space-y-2 text-sm">
          <div><strong>Shift:</strong> 9:00 AM – 7:00 PM</div>
          <div><strong>Total Worked:</strong> 10 hours</div>
          <div><strong>Regular Hours:</strong> 8 hours</div>
          <div className="pt-2 border-t border-slate-200 dark:border-slate-700">
            <strong>➡ Overtime Hours = 2 hours</strong>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Common Overtime Scenarios</h2>
      <p>
        Different industries have different overtime rules. Some calculate daily overtime (over 8 hours), others use weekly overtime (over 40 hours), and some use both. Use our <Link href="/" className="text-emerald-600 hover:text-emerald-500 font-medium">hours calculator</Link> to track your daily totals, then add them up for weekly calculations.
      </p>

      <h2>Double-Time and Special Rates</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Double-time:</strong> Some jobs pay 2x rate after 12 hours or on holidays</li>
        <li><strong>Weekend rates:</strong> Saturday/Sunday might have different multipliers</li>
        <li><strong>Holiday pay:</strong> Special rates for working on designated holidays</li>
        <li><strong>Shift differentials:</strong> Night or weekend shifts often pay extra</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Keeping Accurate Records</h2>
      <p>
        Always keep your own time records, even if your employer tracks hours. Use our <Link href="/" className="text-emerald-600 hover:text-emerald-500 font-medium">time duration calculator</Link> to verify payroll calculations and ensure you're paid correctly for every minute worked.
      </p>
