      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Keeping track of work hours is essential whether you're an employee logging time, a freelancer tracking billable hours, or an employer calculating payroll. Doing the math by hand can be messy, especially when shifts cross midnight or include breaks.
      </p>

      <h2>The Problem with Manual Math</h2>
      <p>
        Calculating hours on paper often leads to mistakes. Converting minutes into decimals or subtracting times across AM/PM adds unnecessary complexity. When you're dealing with multiple employees or complex shift patterns, these small errors can add up to significant payroll discrepancies.
      </p>

      <h2>The Fast Solution</h2>
      <p>
        With our free <Link href="/" className="text-emerald-600 hover:text-emerald-500 font-medium">time duration calculator</Link>, you can instantly find the total hours between a start and end time. Just enter your shift start, end, and any breaks, and you'll see the exact duration in hours, minutes, and decimal format.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl my-6">
        <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Example Calculation</h3>
        <div className="space-y-2 text-sm">
          <div><strong>Start:</strong> 9:15 AM</div>
          <div><strong>End:</strong> 5:45 PM</div>
          <div><strong>Break:</strong> 30 minutes</div>
          <div className="pt-2 border-t border-slate-200 dark:border-slate-700">
            <strong>➡ Total Work Hours = 8 hours</strong>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Why Accuracy Matters</h2>
