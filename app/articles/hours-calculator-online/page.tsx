      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Subtracting hours manually is tricky. Mistakes happen easily when converting minutes or crossing over midnight. What should be simple math becomes complicated when dealing with different time formats, 12-hour vs 24-hour clocks, and overnight periods.
      </p>

      <h2>Problems with Manual Time Subtraction</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AM/PM confusion:</strong> Easy to miscalculate when times cross noon or midnight</li>
        <li><strong>Converting 60 minutes into hours:</strong> Mental math errors are common</li>
        <li><strong>Handling overnight shifts:</strong> Calculating from 11 PM to 7 AM manually is error-prone</li>
        <li><strong>Different time formats:</strong> Mixing 12-hour and 24-hour formats causes mistakes</li>
      </ul>
